# LINKED LISTS

Linked lists are a data structure useful for dynamic 
memory allocation and efficiently inserting or deleting elements.
There are different types of linked lists, such as singly(regular) linked lists
and double linked lists(the list follows two directions).

# What I Learned
- How this data structure functions.
- What are its benefits and when it's best to apply it.
- What are the differences between single and double linked lists and how to construct them.
